Education have been an everlasting changing domain. From the early private tutoring by Socrates in Greece or Confucius in China to nowadays Harvard or MIT, the methods are quite different but the goal remains the same.

## Purpose

At all time, education kept the same objective: teach people stuff. Often, education is linked with childhood, from birth to the young adulthood, even though it shouldn't be only confined to this age section only (see the lifelong learning methodology). The main point of learning is to be able to do things we couldn't do before, write, count, speak a foreign language, be an accountant or a surgeon, play guitar and so on. Education comes in all forms and for all age in order for people to become an updated version of themselves. 

Most of the learning we get comes from 2 purpose: need, and will.
- Needs: they first consist of learning to walk and talk, followed by learning to count, read and write, then learn job related knowledge (marketing, finance, development, etc...)
- Will: they can be more diverse: learn the rules of a board game, learn to play an instrument, learn about a country's culture or language, learn to cook, learn how to control one's emotion, how to live healthier and so on...

## Fun Fact 1

Did you know that the University of Bologna and the University of Oxford are the 2 oldest universities in continuous operation? To help you put it in perspective; they were both founded before the creation of the Ottoman empire or the Mongol empire, even 200 years before the beginning of the Aztec Empire. Also, the oldest continuously operating school of the world is The King's School of Canterbury in the UK. It has been founded in 597 AD, the same year as the beginning of the Christianization of England, a few years before the last Roman-Persian War, even before the funding of Islam. However, as you may have guessed the field of studies, pedagogy and tools used are clearly not the same.

## History

First, let's take some time to bring up the origin of the word Education. From the Online Etymology dictionary, education comes from the Latin "educatus", past participle of educare "bring up, rear, educate", which is related to educere "bring out, lead forth". According to "Century Dictionary," educere, of a child, is "usually with reference to bodily nurture or support, while educare refers more frequently to the mind," and, "There is no authority for the common statement that the primary sense of education is to 'draw out or unfold the powers of the mind.'"

The earliest form of organized educational structures known as schools dates back 2000 BC in Egypt. Fast forward to 387 BC, Plato found the Platonic Academy. A few years later, the Library of Alexandria is built. During the middle ages, education regress and only a few religious kept writing and teaching. Starting from the Renaissance, the education comes back to the front scene, but remains accessible only to a few privileged people. Later on, public schools open all over the globe starting with it the age of compulsory education. Today, education is still evolving and it will continue to.

Nowadays, with the rise of Artificial intelligence as a great tool for many activities, more and more people are starting their career or switching their career to the development of AI. To do so, the main way is to create an Artificial neural network (a simplified version of a brain mechanism) that need to be trained with a set of data: that field of work is called "Machine Learning". We're not the only one learning anymore!

## Fun Fact 2

Did you know that not all schools have about the same amount of students ? Of course you do, but did you know that there's a school in Turin, Italy with only one student and one teacher ? And on the other hand, the largest school is located in Lucknow, India at the City Montessori School. It can accommodate up to 55,000 students and 4,500 staff across 18 campuses.

## Output vs Outcome

One of the things that I remember making me wonder was: the difference between the Output and the Outcome. Most of us will probably react by saying "Yeah, it's slightly different, but it's mostly the same.". Well, I was just like that. However the difference was bigger than I thought and can be relevant to take into consideration while doing a lot of things. 

The example that was given to me at that time was heavily related to software development, however, do not worry, it doesn't require any particular tech-knowledge to understand it. Let's say you are given an exercise, that particular exercise is the one below.

Create a software program that takes an un-finished sudoku grid as input and output the solved grid, or an error message is the grid is invalid. 

Pretty simple to understand right? Input: unsolved grid, Output: solved grid. But, where's the Outcome there? Well, the outcome would be that piece of software allowing any given grid to be solved. So here's the thing; on that particular problem if you focus on that specific grid you could just solve it by hand and then output the solved grid, done! Well, yes, your output would be fully correct, but your outcome would be pretty much useless as it would only solve that specific grid.

Now let's make a few comparisons:
- in schools, a student's output will be its grade, his/her outcome will be what he/she will end up gaining from that school: friends, passion for biology, full proficiency in a Spanish, a great analytical mindset, you name it.
- in companies, the output is the turnover, the number of sales, new staff or any other employees KPI. The outcome, however, will be pretty much harder to quantify, it will be something more related to their field of expertise, good memories from travel agencies, healthier body from the gym, transportation from the airline, skills from training centers etc...

That concept of Output vs Outcome is relevant in a lot of fields. Even though I'm putting an emphasis on the Outcome, I do not mean that the output should be neglected in favor of outcome. The outcome is your goal, the outputs are your rail guiding you to that goal.

Outcomes are the difference made by the outputs, without outcomes, there is no need for outputs.

## Personnal experience with education.

I had the chance to be raised in a nice family in a nice part of the world, my education journey was stable and even though I was sometimes a bad student and sometimes a good student, I graduated without any problem. I also got the opportunity to travel a bit, to practice music and sports and on that period I got nothing much more to that. I once tried to avoid a school trip to Italy because I was just too comfortable home to leave, even for 1 week. Eventually, my parents were called for a meeting with my teacher and they end up forcing me to go... It was one of the best experience of my life!

After high school, I joined the newly created Epitech school, it was a kinda-experimental school at the time. Its program focuses on the project, not much theory, just the base, then it's us to your neurons to connect the dots and solve the problems. Its first 3 weeks, called "the swimming pool" as a subtle allegory of you being thrown into a deep pool with no ability to swim, will force you to come at school from 8:42 in the morning until, well, until when you want, but if you go before 10pm you don't really want to succeed don't you. No need to mention that weekend doesn't exist during these 3 weeks. At the end of these 3-weeks, about a quarter of the student already gave up, and now warming up is over.

The five years at Epitech went decrescendo in term of hard working and during the 4th year I had to spend a year abroad in a foreign university. I chose Beijing JiaoTong University (北京交通大学) and learn a lot! Not much from the school, but from my experiences, and my encounter, it also made me evolve from the introvert type to the... a bit less introvert I guess.

Later, while working, I kept learning, both in the IT sector, the education, I also kept learning Chinese. My school time is over, my education's not.
