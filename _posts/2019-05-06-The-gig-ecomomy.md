title: The gig Economy
---

A fairly recent trend is growing at a fast pace in most western countries. You may work with or even be a private contractor (aka freelance) yourself. Well, the "Gig Economy" is the economy based on that type of employment in opposition to the regular employment contracts, and well, it’s booming.

## What’s that?

The origin of the "gig economy" term obviously refers to the economy based on each piece of work being akin to an individual ‘gig.’ It is also sometimes referred to as "sharing economy" (in reference to Airbnb and other Airbnb-like platform), "collaborative economy" or even "platform economy". It is often linked with the 2009 financial crisis, when the unemployed made a living through several part-time jobs(gig-jobs). At the same time, the term has been also linked with the rise of online platforms based on these gig jobs: some of the newest unicorns such as Airbnb or Uber, but also plenty of smaller platforms who helps gives the term a better public image.



## History

Originally gig work referred to 1920s musicians, especially in jazz club. Today’s gig economy is not limited to a specific demographic, drawing in people who would not otherwise be gigging at all. Some of the newcomers in that industry include: retired person who occasionally put a spare room for rent on Airbnb, office workers who picks up an extra passenger on the morning commute by using a ride-hailing app as well as full time mom who does accounting via TaskRabbit. However, the previous target of gig jobs, such as student still remains a very active part of the gig economy, especially in the delivery platform service.


## Today
A lot of people already registered their house on Airbnb, some people are offering online tutoring via online learning platform such as VipKid. At the time this article is written there are about 2 million Uber drivers, 2.9 million hosts on Airbnb, 60k teachers on VIPKid and a lot of other on plenty of platforms 100 companies already operating with that kind of offer.

The share of the U.S. workforce in the gig economy rose from 10.1 percent in 2005 to 15.8 percent in 2015 and "the number of people working on-demand [gig] jobs will grow from 3.9 million Americans in 2016 to 9.2 million by 2021". (Intuit and Emergent Research, "Dispatches from the New Economy: The On-Demand Economy Worker Study", June 2017)

Also, according to a recent study by the McKinsey Global Institute, up to 162 million people in the United States and Europe are involved in some form of independent work. Finally, a study by Intuit predicted that by 2020, 40 percent of American workers would be independent contractors.


## In the future

The same study by Intuit predicted that by 2020, 40 percent of American workers would be independent contractors.

Allowing these person to have a broader variety of profitable activities will be one of these next few years challenge.
