The first Outsperience happened last week. It was a great experience for our first child traveller as well as for his host family of the week. After gathering feedback to help improve our service to deliver the best experience possible, we thought it would be a good idea to share it with you in order to help you picture what does an Outsperience looks like.

## Day -1

The Outsperience begins a while before the actual trip. First and foremost, the family needs to pick a host on our [platform](http://planner.outsperience.com/signup). On the platform, they discuss about the date and time of the trip, the locations, activities, it is also the time to know more about each other, for example food allergies, if the familly have pets or other informations that needs to be shared.

Once all that is set, the Chinese child needs to get a visa. For that 1st Outsperience, it was a UK visa. For unaccompanied minor, there are some restrictions and specifications to know in order to obtain it, but Outsperience is providing support to the family to get it.

## Day 0

This is finally the time to get on the plane and let our first adventurer, 宋晨炜(pronounced Song ChenWei) lives his very first Outsperience

Another day, another program ! Today, the day started with the visit of the city of Windsor, most known for being the home of one of the six Queen's castles: The [Windsor castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle).

Following the visit of the Windsor, the group went on with their trip and reach the [Eton College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton_College). Eton has educated generations of British and foreign aristocracy, and even members of the British royal family.

An Outsperience allows one to discover a new culture, its food, its architecture, its customs, etc... and one but not least its language. So today ChenWei enjoy a dedicated English class from his host Mrs Mortimer

After exercising his brain, it's time for the rest of the body to be exercised. Let's play Badminton !

One of the most important aspects of doing sports is fair-play, so here's a good display of sportsmanship: a proper handshake.

ChenWei start to be more familiar with his new life of the week. He hop on a bike and start to explore by himself the neighbourhood. The experience allows him to discover fairly well his surounding and even manage to buy himself lunch, a good way of practicing his english !
