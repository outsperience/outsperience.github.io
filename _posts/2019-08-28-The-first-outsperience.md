The first Outsperience happened last week. It was a great experience for that first child as well as for his host family of the week. After gathering feedback to help improve our service to deliver the best experience possible, we thought it would be a good idea to share it with you in order to help you be able to ...

## Day -1

The Outsperience begins a while before the actual trip. First and foremost, the family needs to pick a host on our [platform](http://planner.outsperience.com/signup). On the platform, they discuss about the date and time of the trip, the locations, activities, it is also the time to know more about each other, for example food allergies or other informations that needs to be shared.

Once all that is set, the Chinese child needs to get a visa. For that 1st Outsperience, it was a UK visa. For unaccompanied minor, there are some restrictions and specifications to know in order to obtain it, but Outsperience is helping the family to get it.
