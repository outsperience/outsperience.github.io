上个礼拜我们进行了外体的第一次旅行。这次旅行对我们第一个未成年旅客和接待他的家庭来说都是一次很好的体验。为了尽可能的带来最好的体验，在我们收集了所有反馈并且改善了我们的服务后，我们觉得分享出来更能帮助您勾勒外体到底可以带来怎样的经历。

## 临出发

在真正的旅行之前，旅客需要到外体平台上做些准备。第一（最重要的步骤）：旅客需要在我们的[平台](http://planner.outsperience.com/signup)上选择一个负责招待旅客的家庭。 他们可以在平台上讨论这次旅行的日期、天数、景点和活动，这也是一次互相了解的机会，比如对哪些食物过敏或者负责接待的家庭有宠物等其他需要告知的重要的信息。

一旦这些事情都解决了，我们的旅客就剩下签证啦。这次外体首次旅行选择的是英国签证。为了成功得到未成年人独自旅行的签证，需要知道一些限制和相关信息，外体会帮助各个家庭获取签证。

## 第一天

## Day 1

For this 1st day in the UK, The Mortimer family brought 晨炜(ChenWei) to the city of Oxford, which host one of the most famous and the oldest university in the English speaking word: The [University of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford).

After visiting that historically rich city, they decide to do some sports and head for a golf course. Luckily for ChenWei, there's a golf coach in his host family so he could get a proper introduction

After such a rich day and the jetlag starting to hit, a good meal was clearly required and they decided to go out and share some pizzas. Yummy !

## Day 2

Another day, another program ! Today, the day started with the visit of the city of Windsor, most known for being the home of one of the six Queen's castles: The [Windsor castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle).

Following the visit of the Windsor, the group went on with their trip and reach the [Eton College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton_College). Eton has educated generations of British and foreign aristocracy, and even members of the British royal family.

An Outsperience allows one to discover a new culture, its food, its architecture, its customs, etc... and one but not least its language. So today ChenWei enjoy a dedicated English class from his host Mrs Mortimer

After exercising his brain, it's time for the rest of the body to be exercised. Let's play Badminton !

One of the most important aspects of doing sports is fair-play, so here's a good display of sportsmanship: a proper handshake.

ChenWei start to be more familiar with his new life of the week. He hop on a bike and start to explore by himself the neighbourhood. The experience allows him to discover fairly well his surounding and even manage to buy himself lunch, a good way of practicing his english !

## Day 5

You may not know it yet, but ChenWei is actually a pretty solid fencer, so going to England was a good opportunity for him to visit one of the shop of one of the most famous Fencing-focused brand.
